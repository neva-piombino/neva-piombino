## Plants Data API
A simple demo API to serve data about plants, including their:
-common name
-scientific name
-size
-sun needs

and more. 

## Garden App
This API exists to provide services to a Garden App I am developing with React, which will help users identify what types of plants would fit well with their lifestyle, available space, etc. 


## Follow the Project
The project is still under development. Check back on my github for updates. The app should be live by the end of September 2021!
